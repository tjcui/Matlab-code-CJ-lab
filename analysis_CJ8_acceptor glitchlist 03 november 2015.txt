- If events happen in first few frames, they get rounded off to the first frame
- error for the handles of the plots may occur at times
- if it picks nothing up, press x, it goes few traces back
- find more user friendly way to bypass this problem (when it picks nothing up)
- improve method of finding the "borderline". Maybe take the 100 lowest values or fit two Gaussians on the histogram
- fix the "go to" button
- combine Cy5 and Cy3
- Fix the crash when 2----1 click, or don't do that at all
